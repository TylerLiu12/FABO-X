问：您好，我想问您几个关于疫情期间的问题，不知道您是否有时间？ 

答：可以，请问吧。

问：我们都知道，今年春节的时候政府开始采取一些防疫措施。那个时候也是口罩最为短缺的时候。请问您是否也遇到了口罩短缺的问题？如果是的话，您又是如何解决的呢？

答：是的，我们家的口罩确实也不大够用。出于安全考虑，我们也取消了利用春节假期外出旅游的计划。所以减少了一些对口罩的需求。另外，我们在过年前也准备了充足的年货，所以其实也没有什么出门的必要。因此在那段时间里，虽然口罩也不多，但是并没有出现什么大问题。

问：是的，春节期间的需求确实不大。但是请问在春节之后、大家开始上班之后呢？

答：嗯，开始上班后，我们对口罩的需求确实上升了，不过我们从得知疫情的消息开始就陆续在网上订购一些口罩。我父母工作的单位也给他们的员工免费分发口罩。另外，当时我们社区的药店也免费提供一些口罩，但是是需要预约的。我还记得，那一阵子我爸每天晚上都盯着手表，然后准时在网上预约口罩，比往年春节抢红包还积极。

问：那么你们上班之后会经常更换口罩吗？一个口罩大概会使用多久呢？

答：一开始使用每个口罩的时间还是有些长，大概两三天换一个口罩。当时有一种放在口部与口罩之间的口罩布，我们大概每天都会更换口罩布，但是两三天左右会换一个口罩。后来口罩充足了，也就一天换一个了。

问：谢谢您的配合。有了这次的经验，相信大家也会在日常生活中准备一些基本的医疗用品吧。

答：哈哈，确实是的。

Interviewer:Hello, I would like to ask you a few questions about the epidemic period. I wonder if you have the time?

Interviewee:Yes, please.

Interviewer: As we all know, the government began to take some anti-epidemic measures during the Spring Festival this year.It was also the time when masks were in greatest shortage.Are you also experiencing a mask shortage?If so, how did you solve it?

Interviewee:Yes, we don't really have enough masks at the beginning.For safety reasons, we have also cancelled our plans to travel during the Spring Festival holiday.So there was less need for masks.In addition, we have prepared plenty of goods before the Spring Festival, so there is no need to go out.So during that time, there were not many masks, but there were no major problems.

Interviewer:Indeed, demand during the Spring Festival should be modest.But what about after the Spring Festival, after everyone starts work?

Interviewee:Well, our demand for masks did rise after we started working, but we started ordering some online as soon as we heard about the outbreak.The company where my parents work also gives out free masks to their employees.In addition, the drugstore in our community also provided some masks for free at that time, but an appointment was required.I still remember a time when my father would stare at his watch every night and book a mask online on time. He was more active than usual in snatching red envelopes during the Spring Festival.

Interviewer:Haha. That's interesting. In addition, do you often change your face mask after work?How long will a mask last?

Interviewee:It's still a bit long to start with each mask, maybe two or three days.At that time, there was a mask cloth between the mouth and the mask. We would change the mask cloth every day, but we would change a mask in two or three days.Then I had enough masks, so I had to change them every day.

Interviewer:Thank you for your cooperation.With this experience, I believe you will also prepare some basic medical supplies in your daily life.

Interviewee:Ha ha, indeed it is.
